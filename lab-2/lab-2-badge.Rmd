In this lab you will respond to a set of prompts for two parts.

### Part I: Data Product

For the data product, you will interpret a different type of model -- a model in a *regression* mode.

So far, we have specified and interpreted a *classification* model: one predicting a dichotomous outcome (i.e., whether students pass a course). In many cases, however, we are interested in predicting a continuous outcome (e.g., students' number of points in a course or their score on a final exam).

While many parts of the machine learning process are the same for a regression machine learning model, one key part that is relevant to this lab is different: their interpretation. The confusion matrix we created to parse the predictive strength of our classification model [does not pertain]{.underline} to regression machine learning models. Different metrics are used. For this lab, you will specify and interpret a regression machine learning model.

The requirements are as follows:

-   Change your outcome to **students' final exam performance** (note: check [the data dictionary](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset) for a pointer!).

-   Using the same data (and testing and training data sets), recipe, and workflow as you used in the case study, **change the mode** of your model from classification to regression and change the **engine** from a glm to an lm model.

-   **Interpret your regression machine learning model** in terms of three regression machine learning model metrics: **MAE**, **MSE**, and **RMSE**. Read about these metrics [here](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/process.html#model-eval). Similar to how we interpreted the classification machine learning metrics, focus on the substantive meaning of these statistics.

Please use the code chunk below for your code:

```{r}



```

Please add your interpretations here:

-   MAE:

-   MSE:

-   RMSE:


### Part II: Reflect and Plan

1.  What is an example of an outcome related to your research interests that could be modeled using a *classification* machine learning model?

-   

2.  What is an example of an outcome related to your research interests that could be modeled using a *regression* machine learning model?

-   

3.  Look back to the study you identified for the first machine learning lab badge activity. Was the outcome one that is modeled using a classification or a regression machine learning model? Identify which mode(s) the authors of that paper used and briefly discuss the appropriateness of their decision.

-   

### Knit and Publish

Complete the following steps to knit and publish your work:

1.  First, change the name of the `author:` in the [YAML header](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/rmarkdown-anatomy.html#yaml-metadata) at the very top of this document to your name. The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't actually display in the final output.

2.  Next, click the knit button in the toolbar above to "knit" your R Markdown document to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder. You should see a formatted webpage appear in your Viewer tab in the lower right pan or in a new browser window. Let's us know if you run into any issues with knitting.

3.  Finally, publish your webpage on RPubs by clicking the "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane after you knit your document. See screenshot below.


Have fun!
